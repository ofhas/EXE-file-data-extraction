# EXE-file-data-extraction

In this project we'll demonstrate the use of the subprocess module, list comprehension, multithreading(consumer and producer), sets and python simulated webserver, the main purpose of this project is to extract the output of the exe file that spits out differet data output, some of the data is a json object which has 3 properties, data, events and timestamp, we'll count the number of different events and data and display it by using list comprehension and the subprocess module on a localhost page.
  
you'll need to preform the following steps in order to run the process:\
1, save all files: big.py and generator-windows-amd64.exe file at the same folder.\
2, open a localhost:8080 at your browser.\
The data of the output extraction should appear at the localhost page you've open as a json objects, in order to get the updated data you should refresh the page every time.
